fatfs-minimal
=============

this demo shows how to build with a fat filesystem and console USART with no OS.
the flash Usage should be very very small.


boards
------

 - uemb1 
 - uemb4
 - HY-STM32_100P
 - Any stm32f1 or stm32f4 board with SDIO and a console USART support would work.


test
----

 - note the led flashes
 - the number of flashes is defined in a file on the SD card
